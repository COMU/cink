Changes since 2.9.8:
* The addSession* and split* D-Bus calls now return the id of the newly-
  created session or terminal, or -1 if creating a new session or terminal
  was not possible.
* When the window is set not to show on all virtual desktops and is not
  residing on the current virtual desktop, but is open (i.e. set to stay
  open regardless of focus loss), the Open/Retract action normally used
  to either retract it, or, when the option to also use the action to
  focus the window is enabled, cause the window manager to switch to the
  virtual desktop the window resides on. The former case, i.e. when the
  option to also use the action to focus the window is disabled, has now
  been changed to move the window to the current virtual desktop and focus
  it, rather than retract it.
* A number of default keyboard shortcuts have been changed to reestablish
  consistency with Konsole, which introduced changed defaults in KDE Soft-
  ware Compilation v4.6.
* Yakuake now depends on KDE Platform 4.4.0 or newer.


Changes in 2.9.8:
* Added a new "Ask the window manager to perform the animation" option to
  the animation settings (only shown if Yakuake is running in a KDE Plasma
  Workspace v4.6 or newer). If this option is enabled (it is by default)
  and the KDE Desktop Effect "Sliding Popups" is enabled as well, the ani-
  mation will be performed by KDE's window manager KWin, for much improved
  smoothness on many systems.
* Added keyboard shortcuts to attempt to grow the active terminal in the
  left, right, top or bottom direction by 10px, as well as D-Bus calls to
  attempt to grow any particular terminal by a given amount of pixels in
  one of these directions.
* Skin authors can now control whether the title bar text is set in a bold
  weight or not with the 'bold' key in the 'Text' group of title.skin. The
  default is to use a bold weight to preserve existing behavior.
* Fixed a bug causing the "Keep above other windows" preference not to be
  respected immediately when toggling the "Keep window open when it loses
  focus" preference from the title bar or the main menu.
* The contents of the "Screen" sub-menu in the main menu now get updated
  when the number of screens attached to the system changes.
* Yakuake now depends on KDE 4.3.


Changes in 2.9.7:
* Fixed compilation with gcc 4.4 (missing cstdio include).
* Fixed quit action bypassing the "Confirm quit when more than one session
  is open" setting.
* When "Prevent Closing" is toggled for a tab an appropriate icon will now
  be shown on the tab label. The icon can be provided by the skin, or, if
  the skin does not provide one, it will be procured from the system icon
  theme.
* Thanks to API improvements in the KDE libraries in KDE SC 4.4 a KNotify
  notification is now used for announcing that Yakuake was started success-
  fully, rather than the passive popup in the top-left desktop corner used
  with older versions of the KDE platform.
* Middle-clicking a tab closes it now, consistent with many other KDE apps.
* Tabs can now also be dragged using middle-mouse, again for consistency
  with many other KDE apps.
* Fixed a bug where dragging an inactive tab to a new position on the tab
  bar would show the tab as selected after the drop, but the terminal
  area wouldn't actually show the corresponding terminal(s).
* Fixed a bug causing the empty area of the tab bar to become draggable as
  if if was the last tab that had been clicked.
* Fixed a bug causing the title bar corner images of a theme not to be shown
  when they don't have an alpha channel.
* Fixed a bug causing the window to appear at a distance away from the top
  edge of the screen matching the height of a panel at the top edge of
  another screen in a multi-screen setup.


Changes in 2.9.6:
* Fixed interactive rename of sessions not working reliably - either failing
  to implement a rename or renaming the wrong session - once tabs had been
  moved or sessions closed, due to a mixup of tab indices and session IDs in
  the rename code.
* Updated the application icon in the bottom-left corner graphic of the de-
  fault skin.
* Updated the icon for the default skin in the configuration dialog's skin
  list to the new application icon.


Changes in 2.9.5:
* Added a new framework, referred to as the visual event overlay, to display
  notifications (and potentially other information) on top of the terminals.
  It's used for a number of new features found in this release, as described
  in their separate entries.
* Added an option to visually indicate the newly-focussed terminal when mo-
  ving focus in a session with multiple terminals (i.e. via splits), or the
  currently focussed terminal when switching to a session with multiple ter-
  minals. This make the lives of users easier who prefer to use the "I-Beam"
  or "Underline" cursors styles in the terminal, as those cursor styles do
  not indicate terminal focus as the "Block" style does. The visual indica-
  tion used here is a brief, translucent overlay in the global color scheme's
  hover decoration color. This feature is realized using the new visual event
  overlay described in a separate entry.
* Added a feature to disable keyboard input for all or individual terminals
  in a session. Both variants are available from the tab context menu; the
  session-wide toggle is also available in the keyboard shortcuts configura-
  tion. When typing into a terminal that has keyboard input disabled the
  terminal will briefly flash red. When hovering one of the per-terminal
  toggles in the context menu, the affected terminal will be highlighted
  in the global color scheme's hover decoration color. The latter two aspects
  of this new feature have been realized using the new visual event overlay
  described in a separate entry. Furthermore, new D-Bus interfaces have been
  added to get/set this state bit for both sessions and terminals.
* Added a feature to lock a session to prevent it from being closed acciden-
  tally, available from the tab context menu as well as in the keyboard short-
  cuts configuration. When trying to close a locked session or its active ter-
  minal via Yakuake's own actions/shortcuts, a warning dialog will be display-
  ed, and also when trying to quit Yakuake with any locked sessions. Note that
  this doesn't cover closing a terminal from within the Konsole KPart provi-
  ding the terminal (such as running "exit" or via the terminal's context
  menu), however. New D-Bus interfaces have been added to get/set this state
  bit for sessions.
* Added support for moving tabs on the tab bar by drag and drop.
* Added an option to open the application window after program start.
* Improved graphics for the window state lock button in the default skin.
* Added a slightly improved version of the application icon (again done by
  Oxygen lead artist Nuno Pinheiro) along with a 256x256px variant.
* Added D-Bus interfaces for splitting.
* Added the frequently-requested 'sessionIdForTerminalId(int terminalId)'
  and 'terminalIdsForSessionId(int sessionId)' D-Bus interfaces.
* The auto-open-on-mouse-pointer-hitting-the-screen edge feature now checks
  the position of the mouse pointer against the actual position and width of
  the window rather than triggering on the entire screen edge. This way, the
  screen corners are freed up e.g. for KWin Desktop Effects triggers with
  the default Yakuake window width of 90% work area width.
* Rewrote fullscreen handling, fixing bugs such as exiting fullscreen mode
  on virtual desktop switch.
* Rewrote the translucency support not to use X11-specific code on KDE 4.3 or
  higher.
* Fixed a regression from the background painting changes in 2.9.4 that
  caused splitter handles between terminals to appear in the user-confi-
  gured background color.
* Fixed crashes when closing sessions with certain split setups (also on quit).
* Fixed crash when changing window width/height from the menu with Qt 4.5
  (also generally improves efficiency of window size changes).
* Fixed the 'removeTerminal(int terminalId)' D-Bus call always closing the
  active terminal of the session containing the target terminal, rather than
  the target terminal.
* Fixed interactive tab rename always renaming the active tab, rather than
  the tab the line edit was invoked for and shown on top of.
* Fixed the interactive rename line edit possibly getting hidden also when a
  session other than the one that is being renamed gets deleted, rather than
  just when the session that is being renamed gets deleted.
* Slightly improved options layout on the Behavior page of the configuration
  dialog and made sure that the skin list on the Appearance page scrolls so
  that the selected skin is visible when the list is shown.
* On KDE 4.2 and higher, the first-run dialog now no longer allows setting
  a multi-key shortcut to open/close the window, consistent with the short-
  cut configuration dialog (the required API is new in 4.2). The reason
  multi-key global shortcuts are not allowed in KDE is that they don't work.
* Fixed linking with the new gold linker in binutils.
* Updated KDE4FAQ file (animation performance).


Changes in 2.9.4:
* Added a new Oxygen-style application icon made by Nuno Pinheiro. In addi-
  tion to fitting much better into KDE 4 visually, it's now also available
  in all standard sizes up to 128px plus as SVG (whereas the old icon was
  only available in 16px and 32px), meaning you won't see a blurry Yakuake
  icon in various places in KDE 4 anymore as you did before.
* Added a setting to fill with the configurable background color at a given
  opacity before painting the skin elements. In effect, this allows some con-
  trol over the opacity and color tint of translucent areas of the skin.
* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to move a session located at the
  start or end of the tab bar back after moving it left/right using the
  keyboard shortcuts.
* Various updates to the KDE4FAQ file related to performance and rendering.


Changes in 2.9.3:
* Added an option to focus individual sub-terminals as the mouse pointer is
  moved over them.
* Added an option to explicitly control whether the window will be shown on
  all (virtual) desktops. Defaults to true, as before.
* Made the error condition when Yakuake is unable to load the Konsole KPart
  component non-destructive, i.e. being unable to load the KPart will no
  longer end in an unavoidable application quit. Instead, a good-looking
  warning will be shown where the terminal would normally be. This also
  takes care of the edge case in which Konsole is uninstalled while Yakuake
  is already running, so that existing terminals won't be lost.
* Fixed a regression that caused the "Show title bar contents in tab labels"
  preference to no longer work.
* Fixed tab label not immediately being updated upon creating a new session
  when "Show title bar contents in tab labels" is enabled.


Changes in 2.9.2:
* The item background in the skin list is now determined by the style en-
  gine if on KDE 4.1 (including pre-release versions) and hence Qt 4.4.
* Fixed title bar not immediately being updated upon creating a new single-
  terminal session.
* Fixed shortcuts with versions of KDE 4 trunk (4.1) from April 22nd 2008
  and newer. The Konsole KPart now defaults to overriding shortcuts, and
  Yakuake must do additional work to continue to receive them.


Changes in 2.9.1:
* Starting Yakuake a second time now toggles the window state, making it
  possible to open and retract Yakuake from a panel button or by simply
  running the executable.
* Disabled standard startup notifications ("Launch Feedback") for Yakuake.
* Fixed Open/Retract action not working with versions of KDE 4 trunk (4.1)
  after March 10th, 2008.
* Fixed a bug that could cause actions also available from the tab context
  menu to operate on the wrong session when triggered by keyboard shortcut
  and the context menu had been used previously.
* Fixed the "Close Active Terminal", "Split Left/Right" and "Split Top/Bot-
  tom" actions not operating on the correct session when activated from the
  context menu of a tab other than the active tab.
* Some additions to the KDE4FAQ file.


Changes in 2.9 (KDE 4):
- Changes since 2.9-beta1:
* Changed default shortcut of the "Quit" action to Ctrl+Shift+Q for consis-
  tency with Konsole and to avoid clashing with the KPart's "Resume output"
  action.
* Fixed a bug that caused the "Previous Session" action not to work when
  trying to move from a newer to an older session after closing sessions
  created and located inbetween.
* Fixed in Konsole: Addressed a shortcut overload that prevented the "Next
  Session" and "Previous Session" default shortcuts from working when using
  Qt 4.4. The fix will be included in KDE 4.0.3 and higher.
* Expanded KDE4FAQ file to cover problems with certain graphics drivers and
  kwin effects.
* Greatly expanded translation coverage.

- Changes in 2.9-beta1:
* Rewritten from scratch for KDE 4.
* Changed license from "GPL v2 or later" to "GPL v2 or v3 or any later ver-
  sion accepted by the membership of KDE e.V.".
* Replaced pseudo-translucency with XComposite translucency (aka "real trans-
  lucency") support (see KDE4FAQ for caveats).
* The context menus of tabs and the main menu now sport additional actions
  to manipulate Konsole profile settings.
* The tab bar itself has gained a context menu as well.
* An option to dynamically update tab labels with information about the
  content of the active terminal has been added.
* The skin engine is now more robust when it comes to processing invalid or
  corrupted skins.
* Skins are now stored in the skins/ sub-directory of the app's data dir.
* The window geometry is now updated dynamically when the work area of the
  screen changes.
* The window title bar now appropriately uses the window title font from the
  KDE font settings rather than the general UI font.
* Changes to the KDE font settings are now applied at runtime.
* Support for right-to-left layouts in the configuration dialog has been
  improved.
* A bug where the "Rename Session..." action would operate on the wrong
  session has been fixed.
* Yakuake no longer crashes when Konsole is not installed, but instead can-
  cels startup with a preceding error dialog.
* Lots of internal cleanup.


Changes in 2.8.1 (KDE 3):
* Added an option to control whether the Yakuake window keeps above other
  windows.
* Improved experience for non-KDE users by disabling KRootPixmap-based
  pseudo-translucency for them. Gets rid of rendering errors with skins
  that make use of the alpha channel. Replaced by configurable skin back-
  ground color.
* Fix leftover gap below the window at 100% height or in fullscreen mode.
* Added option to automatically open the Yakuake window when the pointer
  touches the screen edge it lives on.


Changes in 2.8:
- Changes since 2.8-beta1:
* Made the new behavior of the Open/Retract action focussing an already
  open Yakuake window optional.
* The Xinerama screen setting is now updated when the window is moved to
  a different screen using facilities outside of Yakuake itself, such as
  the new shortcuts provided by Lubos Lunak's Xinerama Improvements patch-
  set for KWin 3.5.x. The window size and position get updated to fit the
  new bounding box accordingly.
* Initial session tab label naming is now consistent with Konsole. Instead
  of naively incrementing the shell number, the lowest available number is
  used.
* Swapped horizontal and vertical split actions for consistency with Kate.
* Added slotSessionName() and slotSessionName(int session_id) DCOP Calls.
* Added sessionIdList() and terminalIdList(int session_id) DCOP calls.
* Naming consistency improvements in the DCOP interface.
* Added more What's This help in the config dialog.
* Minor interface wording improvements.
* Greatly expanded translation coverage.

- Changes in 2.8-beta1:
* Added a proper config dialog. Scale and position settings are previewed in
  real-time as the controls are moved.
* Added a Skins page to the config dialog, allowing to list, choose, install and
  remove (given the necessary write permissions) skins. The skin format has been
  slightly augmented to allow skins to ship a preview icon for the list. Skins can
  be switched at runtime without a restart.
* The Plastik skin by Daniel 'suslik' D. has been added to the base package.
* Added support for splitting a session into multiple terminals. Horizontal and
  vertical splits can be added and removed at will, as well as resized and
  collapsed. To add a split at the active terminal's position, use the keyboard
  shortcuts or the session tab context menu. To open a session preconfigred with
  a certain split layout click and hold the New Session button on the tab bar,
  then choose from the list, or set up keyboard shortcuts for the preconfigured
  session types in the shortcut dialog.
* The main menu has been redesigned to conform more to established KDE practices
  in layout and naming. Several items have been added corresponding to new Yakuake
  features.
* Added a fullscreen mode.
* Improved support for Xinerama multi-head setups.
* Added a first-run dialog to allow changing the open/close shortcut before it
  is needed. Note: First-time users of this Yakuake version will be greeted by
  this dialog as well.
* Added an About dialog.
* The startup notification popup can now be disabled in the config dialog.
* Activating the open/close shortcut will now bring the Yakuake window to the
  foreground and focus it if it was already open but unfocussed, at popular
  request.
* Opening dialogs from Yakuake will no longer cause the window to retract.
* Tabs can now be moved. Added corresponding keyboard shortcuts.
* Tabs now have context menus containing several relevant actions, such as
  moving and closing them.
* Double-clicking the tab-bar will now open a new session, consistent with
  Konsole and other KDE applications.
* Renaming a tab using the in-line edit feature now requires a double-click on
  the tab, consistent with established KDE behavior.
* The in-line tab renaming control can now be cancelled with ESC.
* Fixed the interaction model of the tab bar and the buttons to allow cancelling
  activations by releasing the mouse button outside of them.
* Added various new keyboard shortcuts corresponding to new Yakuake features and
  improved consistency with Konsole in existing shortcuts (e.g. added the
  alternate new session shortcut from Konsole).
* Added keyboard shortcuts to switch to session 1 through 12.
* Added keyboard shortcuts to adjust the width and height of the window.
* Added an action and shortcut to paste the X11 selection buffer.
* Added an action to quit Yakuake.
* Made the quit warning with multiple open sessions behave consistently with
  Konsole.
* Greatly expanded DCOP interface. Added various new calls corresponding to new
  Yakuake features. Made it easier to get information about the application's
  state out of it, e.g. the title text of a session or sub-terminal. Fixed bugs
  that caused related calls to reply with incorrect information.
* Added What's This help and tooltips to interface elements.
* Optimized the title bar to avoid unnecessary repaints.
* Fixed crashes when using the slotRunCommandInSession DCOP call due to lack of
  bounds-checking. Fixed a similar problem with slotRenameSession.
* Bugs that caused the background updating of translucent parts of the Yakuake
  window to stop have been fixed.
* Adding a translucent session while the window is closed should no longer
  result in a corrupted terminal background when opening the Yakuake window.
* Yakuake will now fall back to the default skin on startup if the skin stored
  in the settings cannot be found, rather than crash.
* Fixed a crash when loading non-translucent button images from skins.
* Bugs that caused the quick access options in the menu to come out of sync with
  the actual settings have been fixed.
* Fixed " - " postfix showing after the session title text when using skins
  without their own postfix.
* Fixed a crash when a terminal in a tab other than the currently selected tab
  exits.
* Ported preferences handling to KDE's KConfigXT framework. Aside from cleaner
  code, this improves over the old preferences handling by avoiding unnecessary
  disk activity (and thus spurious hard drive spin-ups on laptop computers and
  other battery-bound devices).
* Disabled startup notifications (i.e. KDE's bouncing cursor) for Yakuake.
* Updated the installation colation of the .desktop menu file to conform to
  modern XDG standards.


Changes in 2.7.5:
* Further translations have been added.
* Yakuake no longer spawns login shells in new sessions.
* A keyboard shortcut to rename the selected session has been added.
* The default keyboard shortcuts and their names are now consistent with
  Konsole.
* A bug that led to the tab bar not updating after a slotSelectSession DCOP
  call was issued has been fixed.
* A bug that could lead to the slotRenameSession DCOP call failing to set a
  session label after an older session had been closed has been fixed.
* Upon attempting to set an all-whitespace session label, the label will now
  fall back to its prior setting rather than a default label.
* Yakuake will now display a warning before quitting the application with
  multiple tabs open.


Changes in 2.7.4:
* A bug in the Makefiles that led to the configure script being run twice has
  been fixed.
* The source code is now localizable. First translations are included.
* A bug that could result in a crash on quit has been fixed.
* A bug that could prevent the first line in a new session from being used up to
  the full width of the terminal has been fixed.
* The COLORTERM environment variable is now being set in new sessions,
  triggering the color detection of Midnight Commander.
* The default session labels are now consistent with Konsole.
* Whitespace at the beginning or end of session labels will now be trimmed.
* Setting all-whitespace session labels is no longer possible.


Changes in 2.7.3:
* Inline renaming of tabs by double-clicking on the tab label
* Processes can now interact with titlebar text
* DCOP call slotToggleState to open/close Yakuake
* DCOP call slotGetSelectedSession
* DCOP call slotSetTitleText
