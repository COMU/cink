** What is a Yakuake skin?

   A Yakuake skin, at present, is a collection of PNG image files and related
   settings that allows modifying the visual appearance of the Yakuake window
   frame, the window title bar and the tab bar along with the button controls
   on them and the default title bar caption.


** How is a Yakuake skin composed?

   A Yakuake skin consists of a main directory, the name of which is used by
   the application to identify that skin, and the files within. Two required
   files are title.skin and tabs.skin located immediately in that directory.
   Both are INI-style text files which contain the paths of the pixmaps that
   are to be applied to the title bar and tab bar interface elements, res-
   pectively, as well as the coordinates of the buttons and additional infor-
   mation about the skin, such as its display name, its author and the email
   address of the author.

   You should derive new skins from the default skin. Please remember to
   change the name of the base skin directory (which serves as identifier),
   the skin display name, and include author information.


** How should I package a Yakuake skin?

   The "Skins" page in the Yakuake configuration dialog features an "Install
   Skin" facility that can install Yakuake skin directories packaged as a
   tar archive and optionally compressed using gzip or bzip2. Packages can be
   installed from a local volume or a URL (using KIO).

   In managing skins, Yakuake uses the name of the base skin directory loca-
   ted within the tar archive as internal identifier for the skin. It should
   be unique to your skin, i.e. ideally a simplified version of the proper
   name of your skin.

   The skin list on the "Skins" config dialog page reads the Name and Author
   properties from the *.skin files to populate list items with information.
   Additionally, it will try to load a 32x32px image file given via the Icon
   property to show as artwork next to the skin name.
